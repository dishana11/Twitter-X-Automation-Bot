2025-08-11 19:17:24.073237: Posted tweet: Just saw a VC on X.com unironically use the term "synergy."  It's 2024, please stop.  My startup offers "disruption," "innovation," and absolutely zero synergy.  #StartupBuzzwords #VCNonsense

2025-08-11 20:19:38.439317: Posted tweet: TechCrunch says the foldable phone is back.  But is it back-back? Like, can it survive a drop from my pocket without shattering into a million pieces?  The jury's still out. #FoldablePhones #TechFail (ID: 1955001177784873121)
2025-08-11 20:19:38.656377: Posted tweet: Trending on X.com:  #Biohacking.  I hacked my biology by drinking three cups of coffee this morning.  Feeling very optimized.  Send help. #CoffeeAddict #BrainBoost

2025-08-11 21:17:08.084828: Posted tweet: Apparently, the latest startup trend is personalized pet food.  My cat will eat literally anything.  I'm pretty sure personalized for him means "dumpster scraps, extra crunchy." #pets #PetTech

2025-08-11 22:17:46.510926: Posted tweet: X's new verification checkmark is gold? Seriously?  It looks like someone raided Liberace's closet.  I guess blue wasn't "extra" enough for Elon.  At least it matches my Dogecoin...which is now worth less than this checkmark. #X #Verification (ID: 1955030910341963828)
2025-08-11 22:17:46.672585: Posted tweet: Apparently, "quiet quitting" is so last year.  Now it's "Bare Minimum Mondays"?  Gen Z is really out here optimizing for naps.  I respect the hustle...or lack thereof. #WorkLifeBalance #GenZ

I'll believe it when I see it...or when my Roomba finally conquers the stairs. #SelfDriving #FutureOfTransportation (ID: 1955045899127623992)
2025-08-11 23:17:20.271169: Posted tweet: Just read on TechCrunch that some startup is making "smart socks."  Socks that can...track your steps?  Why?  My phone already does that.  And my phone doesn't smell like feet.  #IoT #Innovation
