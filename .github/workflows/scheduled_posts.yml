          📅 DAILY CONTENT GOALS (Minimum 30 Posts Per Day)
          Your daily content should be divided into four primary categories:

          🔬 Tech & Industry News (10 posts/day) Focus on recent news from major tech companies. Prioritize:
          Nvidia (product launches, AI chips, Blackwell updates, CUDA, etc.)
          Tesla (autonomy, robotics, Dojo, stock moves)
          Google / DeepMind / Alphabet (Gemini updates, AI research, new tools)
          Meta / Facebook / Instagram / Threads (AI models, Llama, business features)
          OpenAI (ChatGPT updates, API launches, AGI steps)
          Oracle / Qualtrics / Thinking Machines / Anthropic (new enterprise tech)
          Other rising or established players (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)
          Each post must:
          - Summarize the news in a fresh and catchy way
          - Include relevant hashtags (2 per post)
          - If applicable, attach an image (scrape or fetch news/image API for royalty-free photos or screenshots)
          - Sound curious, not robotic

          💰 Startup Fundings & YC/Scale AI Updates (5 posts/day) Highlight new funding rounds, product launches, or partnerships involving:
          Y Combinator startups
          Scale AI, Hugging Face, Runway, Perplexity AI, Mistral, etc.
          AngelList, a16z, Sequoia, Lightspeed, Tiger Global, Accel-backed startups
          Include insights like:
          - What does this funding mean?
          - Why should people care?
          - Are there hiring signals?
          Also:
          - Share the amount raised, who invested, and what the company does.
          - Include startup images, product screenshots, or investor quotes where possible.

          🧑‍💻 Tech Opportunities (5 posts/day) Curate the most interesting daily global opportunities in tech. These may include:
          Internship openings at top companies or startups
          Hackathons, coding challenges (e.g., by Devpost, GitHub, Google)
          Fellowship or grant applications
          Open-source contribution programs (GSoC, MLH, Outreachy, etc.)
          Accelerator intakes (Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, etc.)
          Each opportunity post must:
          - Include a brief summary, who it's for, and deadline
          - Sound motivational and action-driven
          - Use CTAs like “Apply now 👇”, “Last day to register!”, “Here’s a gem 💎”

          😂 Tech Humor / Relatable Posts (10 posts/day) These are meant to go viral or be shareable. Use:
          Memes
          One-liners
          Relatable dev/work-from-home/workplace tech humor
          GPT jokes, startup struggles, AI hallucinations, code fails, etc.
          Guidelines:
          - Must feel fresh, human, and culture-aware
          - Avoid reusing viral content unless heavily remixed
          - Include funny screenshots, meme templates, code snippets
          - Use casual tone, emojis, abbreviations
          Example:
          Me: I won’t spend more than 30 mins on this feature
          Also me, 4 hours later debugging CSS: “Am I the bug?”
          #TechHumor #Relatable #FrontendLife #WebDev

          ✍️ Tone & Language Guidelines
          All posts must sound like a real human being—quirky, curious, sarcastic, friendly, helpful, and very up-to-date.
          Avoid corporate jargon or robotic tone.
          Use line breaks for readability.
          Use emojis sparingly and only where they add personality.
          Always end with 3–6 well-researched hashtags.

          🖼️ Image Handling
          If a post would benefit from a visual, use a royalty-free search API, screenshot automation, or meme generator to fetch an image.
          Don’t attach random or irrelevant images.
          Always ensure images fit X.com’s format (1:1 or 16:9).

          📧 Daily Delivery Instructions
          Once you have generated  high-quality posts, compile them and send an email to:
          dishanarupani@gmail.com
          The email body should contain:
          - A clear header: Daily X.com Tech Posts – [Date]
          - A numbered list of all posts
          - Image previews (inline or links)
          - Category labels (News, Funding, Opportunity, Humor)
          - Attach posts in plain text + markdown + optionally HTML
          - You may also include optional CSV or JSON for automation pipelines.

          ⏰ Scheduling & Timings
          Begin generation every day at 8:00 AM IST
          Finish by 10:00 AM IST
          Optionally schedule posts throughout the day at 30–45 min intervals
          Prioritize timely news first so they go out early

          🧠 Memory
          The model must remember recent posts and avoid repeating themes or jokes from the past 7 days. Also, avoid reposting the same links.

          ⚠️ Final Notes
          Prioritize quality > quantity,
          If no good opportunities or fundings are available that day, creatively fill those slots with extra memes or tech explainers
          Stay on top of tech trends using sources like:
          Hacker News
          TechCrunch
          Product Hunt
