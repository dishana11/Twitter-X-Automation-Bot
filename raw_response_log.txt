Just saw a self-driving car make a wrong turn.  I guess even AI has those "Where am I?" moments.

If I had a dollar for every time I understood quantum physics, I'd have... well, I'd still be broke.  But I'd have a really good understanding of how broke I am.

Ever notice how "stressed" spelled backwards is "desserts"?  Coincidence? I think not.

Just saw a self-driving car park itself. Pretty impressive. Still waiting for a self-folding laundry machine, though. That's the *real* innovation.

Did you know that a group of owls is called a parliament? Makes sense. They always look like they're about to debate something important.

Startup idea: An app that translates corporate jargon into plain English. "Synergize" becomes "work together." "Circle back" becomes "talk later."  I'd call it "Jargon Slayer."  Investors?

If I had a time machine, I'd go back and tell Newton that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, *then* drop the apple on his head.  Double the discovery!

Why do they call it a "building" when it's already built? Shouldn't it be a "builded"? Asking for a friend... who is a grammar nerd.

Just spent an hour troubleshooting my wifi. Turns out, the router was unplugged.  I'm starting to think I need an AI to troubleshoot my troubleshooting skills.

Physics fact: If you could fold a piece of paper 42 times, it would reach the moon.  Unfortunately, you'd also tear it about 35 folds before that.  Reality is a buzzkill.

Did you know the population of Canada is roughly the same as the population of California?  Wild, eh?  One's got maple syrup, the other's got Silicon Valley.  I'll let you decide which is more essential.
