Longer post alert! So, I was thinking about the invention of the wheel. Like, imagine being the first caveperson to witness that.  You'd probably go back to your cave and be like, "Guys, you are NOT going to believe this…".  And then they'd probably grunt and ask if you'd brought back any mammoth steaks.  The struggle is real, even in the Stone Age. #Innovation #History
